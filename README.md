This application is my fourth major project developed as a part of my coursework in collaboration with a fellow student, [Sakib Avdiba≈°iƒá](https://github.com/Sakib-Avdibasic), at Internacionalna poslovno-informaciona akademija Tuzla. It was built using the Qt framework in C++.

The application displays a list of contacts that are loaded from a "contacts.csv" file upon startup. The user interface shows information such as first name, last name, email, phone number, and the contact category.

Key features of the application include full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing contacts. Users can edit or delete existing contacts and add new ones. The application also allows importing contacts from a .csv file and exporting the current list to a .csv file, enabling users to save any changes made to the contact list.

The main screen (MainWindow) offers a search function to find contacts by first or last name, and the ability to filter and display contacts by category, such as "Business" or "Friends". When creating a new contact, users can assign a desired category, or later update it through the "Edit" option.

One interesting feature is that double-clicking on a contact's email address opens a "mailto:" form, allowing users to send an email directly to the contact. Additionally, since each contact's date of birth is recorded, the application automatically generates a birthday greeting message ready to be sent via email when it is the contact's birthday.

Users can also create a completely new (empty) contact list. The application includes a history of changes (patchlist) and a record of the Qt environment in which it was developed.

The application boasts a modern design, with significant attention given to functionality and user experience (UX). Most interactions are performed through the graphical interface, which are showcased in the screenshots shown above.
